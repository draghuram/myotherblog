A *Pantograph* is an instrument used to copy a drawing or a
plan. According to its 
[Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantograph),
the first *Pantograph* was built in 1603. Incredible!

Here is a modern version made with K'nex. It is very simple to make so
I hope the video inspires at least some of you to try it.
