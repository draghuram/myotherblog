Welcome! Apart from my 
[technical interests](http://draghuram.github.io), I like building
stuff using various materials. Principal among these is 
[K'nex](http://www.knex.com/). Other materials include paper and
wood. 

This blog is going to be mostly about various models that I
(and/or our family) build. From time to time, I might also write about
other miscellaneous stuff but right now, I don't have a clue what that is
going to be. 

That is all for now. More later.
