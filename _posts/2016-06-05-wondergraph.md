A *Wondergraph* is a drawing machine that produces a wide variety of
symmetric and beautiful designs. An article describing how to build
one appeared in the *Boys Mechanic* magazine in 1913. I
noticed it in a book I borrowed from our local library. The
book was a compilation of few such articles from the *Boys Mechanic*
magazines. You can find the article 
[here]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/boy-mechanic-book-1-1913-how-to-make-a-wondergraph-extract.pdf).

Now, the original instructions use wood as the building material but I
wanted to build it with [K'nex](http://www.knex.com/). My first
preference to build any model is K'nex as it is much easier to
experiment with. As far as I know, this is the first time any one used
K'nex to build such a model. 

The result can be seen in the following Youtube videos. We have
displayed the model in local Makerfaires and it has delighted children
and adults alike. Enjoy!
