Thanks for visiting my blog.

My name is Raghuram Devarakonda and I am currently working as Software
Engineer at [Catalogic Software](https://catalogicsoftware.com/). I
blog about techinical stuff at <http://draghuram.github.io>.

This blog is about my other interests, principally about building
stuff. It could be with wood or 
[K'nex](http://www.knex.com/), or with just cardstock
paper. From time to time, I might also write about other miscellaneous
stuff but what exactly it is, only time will tell. 

It also goes without saying that I get lots of help in building these
models, especially from my family.
